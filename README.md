# first solana smart contract

This is a slightly different take on the Solana 'Hello World' example on the solana github. I've slightly refactored the smart contract to keep a running list of messages instead of counting how much it has been called. Now, clients can send a message to the contract and add it to the runnning list. I have some javascript tests included in the repo as well that are fairly easy to refactor and customize to what you want. 


My plan is to play around with this a lot to try to get more familiar with writing smart contract code.
